### R basics

#### Assignment
There are 3 different assignment operators in R, left (<-), right (->) and equal (=). 

NOTE, there are some scoping rules relating to the equals sign.

The most common one is the left assignment operator, and right arrow assignment is rarely used.

```{r}

```




This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

$y(x) = f(x)$
