`ls()` gives you information about the objects in the environment
`ls.str()` gives details about the objects in the environment


### R basics

#### Assignment
There are 3 different assignment operators in R, left (<-), right (->) and equal (=). 

NOTE, there are some scoping rules relating to the equals sign.

The most common one is the left assignment operator, and right arrow assignment is rarely used.


#### Basic arithmetic and basic operations
`sqrt(x)` is the square root of the number. 

R can deal with complex numbers natively.
```{r}
y <- 3 + 2i
Re(y)
Im(y)
y * y
```

#### Modes
Each variable in R is of a particular mode that denotes the storage class. You can check the mode using `mode`. The 3 basic types are *numeric*, *character* and *logical*.

Vectors must be homogeneous, but lists, matrics and data frames can be heterogeneous.

  * `dim` is used to check the dimensions of a matrix.
  * `c(...)` is the combine function used to create vectors?
  * `list(...)` is the constructor for lists
  * `1:10` creates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10. The `c(1:10)` around the sequency is redundant but might be useful for clarity.

#### Sequences of numbers
You can create a sequence of numbers in several ways:

  * `1:10` creates a sequence from 1 to 10
  * `seq(10)`
  * `c(1:10)`
  * `rep(1,10)` repeats 1 ten times.
  * `seq(2,8)` numbers from 2 to 8 with an increment of 1
  * `seq(2,8, 0.5)` numbers from 2 to 8 with an increment 0.5


#### Vectors
The basic data type used in R. Vectors must be homogeneous. They are created using the combine operator `c()`. Vectors have a `mode(x)` and a `length(x)`. 

##### Manipulating vectors
**Adding elements to a vector**
For appending and prepending elements to the vector we use the combine function `c()`

```{r}
x <- 1:5
x <- c(0, x)
x <- c(x, 6)
```
**Indexing single elements of a vector**
Unlike other programming languages, vectors are indexed from 1. For single element indexes there are 3 options:

  * *The index is between 1 and the length*, in which case the result is the element in that position of the element.
  * *Negative index between abs(1:length(x))*, remove the element at that position in the vector
  * *Index larger than abs(length(x))*, results in NA
```{r}
x <- seq(5,8, 0.5)
length(x)
x[2]
x[-4]
x[length(x) + 1]
```

**Indexing multiple elements from a vector**
You can retrieve a vector slice or multiple elements from the vector by using an index vector within the square brackets. The index vector can contain duplicates, be out of order or be a range.
```{r}
x <- seq(5,8, 0.5)
x[c(1,3,6)]
```

**Logical index vector**


##### Arithmetic
**Scalar and vector**
Any arithmetic operation between a scalar and a vector results on the operation being performed to each element of the vector.

```{r}
5 + seq(10)
5 - seq(10)
5 * seq(10)
5 / seq(10)
sqrt(seq(10) ^ 2)
```

**Addition**
When the two vectors have the same length, adding is their point-wise addition.

```{r}
x <- c(1:10)
y <- c(1:10)
x + y
```

If however one vector is shorter than the other one, the smaller vector gets *recycled* to complete the length of larger vector. When the longer one is an exact multiple of the shorter one, this is done quietly without any warning. If the shorter one is not an exact multiple you receive a warning from R.

```{r}
x <- c(1:10)
y <- c(1:2)
x + y

y <- c(1:3)
x + y
```

Adding all the elements of a vector is accomplished using the `sum` function.

```{r}
sum(seq(100))
```

**Multiplication**
Vector multiplication is the pointwise multiplication of each element in a vector.

```{r}
x <- seq(5)
y <- seq(5)
x * y
sum(x * y)
```





This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

$y(x) = f(x)$
